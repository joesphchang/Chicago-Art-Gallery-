## Description:

The website I made is an online gallery walk-through of the Art Institute of Chicago. I was inspired by the artwork that is always showcased throughout the museum itself when I use to visit as a child. You are able to view certain artwork throughout the website that will give you details of the artist and the history of the art piece.
